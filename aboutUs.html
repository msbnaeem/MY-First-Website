        <p>So, I am an undergrad student at the UNC Charlotte pursuing bachelor's of science in computer science. Just like every other major CS major
        have some priorities to fulfill and initiatives to take. Unlike others we have to be keen in doing projects, getting internships,
        and co-ops to get hands on experience. Although it does not help anyone else except you, yourself will find being so especial
        when looking for job / intern opportunities just because you have some real time experience that others don't.
        All this long story was to tell the viewers the reason behind this custurdy website on a grey tray with three blueberries
        is, I did not have any front end related project(s), hence I thought this is a golden chance to build and post
        upload my project to my github or portfolio. However, knowingly speaking, it is not the top project but is enough
        to demonstrate my concepts on that matter. So, no matter what it is., it is atleast better than nothing.</p>
