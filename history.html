        <p>Many different titles have been given to this game, which is especially well-liked in Pakistan and India.
        The word "Court Piece" can also be spelled as "Coat Piece" or "Coat Pees," with "Pees" denoting "to trade" in Hindi.
        This game is frequently referred to as Rang or Rung, which is Pakistani for "trump," in that country.
        One card is played to the table by each player in turn, and these cards are won by the player with the highest card.
        In certain places, like Goa, it is known as Seven Hands. In India, the English word "hand" is occasionally used to denote a "trick."
        Many South Asian games use the word Court, Coat, Kot, or Kout,
        and it is also used in countries as far as Somalia and Malaysia.
        Typically, it refers to a game of trick-taking similar to a slam, in which one team wins all of the tricks or at least
        a string of them while the other team manages to win none. The word Kot's origin is unknown, but according to
        Thierry Depaulis, it might have originated in Tamil or another Dravidian language.</p>
